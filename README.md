# ðŸ§  Dots and Boxes - Reinforcement Learning Game (Q-Learning Agent)

This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic **Dots and Boxes** game using **Reinforcement Learning**. It features a playable environment with **Pygame** where a human player can compete against a trained **Q-learning agent**.

---

## ðŸŽ® Game Overview

Dots and Boxes is a two-player strategy game where players take turns adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots. A player who completes the fourth side of a 1Ã—1 box earns one point and takes another turn. The player with the most points wins.
